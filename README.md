# Tello-AvoidingObstacles
The project is to control the Tello to avoid obstacles by using optical flow method.
The file "FlyFree" can control the drone avoid obstacles successfully. However, the file "FlyFOE" can not control the drone avoid obstacles successfully, though it is programmed by referencing the article "FOE". Theorily speaking, the "FlyFOE" is more reliable, so if you want to achieve the purpose, you can go on programming the project.
